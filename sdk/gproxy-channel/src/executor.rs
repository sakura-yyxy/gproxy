//! Thin single-request executor — the L1 "minimal client" entry point.
//!
//! [`execute_once`] and [`execute_once_stream`] run a complete single
//! upstream request against ONE credential of ONE channel: finalize the
//! request, apply the channel's sanitize / rewrite rules, build the HTTP
//! request, send it, normalize the response body, and classify the
//! result. They do NOT retry, rotate credentials, or track cross-call
//! health state — that is the job of the multi-channel engine in
//! `gproxy-engine`.
//!
//! # Example (illustrative — using the OpenAI channel)
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use gproxy_channel::channels::openai::{OpenAiChannel, OpenAiCredential, OpenAiSettings};
//! use gproxy_channel::routing::RouteKey;
//! use gproxy_channel::executor::execute_once;
//! use gproxy_channel::request::PreparedRequest;
//! use gproxy_protocol::kinds::{OperationFamily, ProtocolKind};
//!
//! # async fn demo() -> Result<(), gproxy_channel::response::UpstreamError> {
//! let channel = OpenAiChannel;
//! let settings = OpenAiSettings::default();
//! let credential = OpenAiCredential { api_key: std::env::var("OPENAI_API_KEY").unwrap() };
//! let http_client = wreq::Client::new();
//!
//! let request = PreparedRequest {
//!     method: http::Method::POST,
//!     route: RouteKey::new(OperationFamily::GenerateContent, ProtocolKind::OpenAiChatCompletion),
//!     model: Some("gpt-4o-mini".to_string()),
//!     body: br#"{"model":"gpt-4o-mini","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}"#.to_vec(),
//!     headers: http::HeaderMap::new(),
//!     path_params: std::collections::BTreeMap::new(),
//! };
//!
//! let outcome = execute_once(&channel, &credential, &settings, &http_client, request).await?;
